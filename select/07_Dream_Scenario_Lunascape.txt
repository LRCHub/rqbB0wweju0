Walk away quietly
Don't make a noise
Hide in the Closet
Or under the Bed
Somehow I find you
I hear you breathe
For all that I can see
You're hidden in my dreams
At least you'd know I'd miss you
Hide in the corner of my mind
There's no way to get you out of there
At least you'd know I'd miss you
At least you'd know I'd miss you
Did you hear me?
For I can hear you
And are you aware
That I can feel you
When you are not around
Somehow you're with me
Imagine you were here
As deep as I can see
You're hidden in my dreams
At least you'd know I'd miss you
Hide in the corner of my mind
There's no way to get you out of there
At least you'd know I'd miss you
At least you'd know I'd miss you
At least you'd know I'd miss you
Did you hear me?
